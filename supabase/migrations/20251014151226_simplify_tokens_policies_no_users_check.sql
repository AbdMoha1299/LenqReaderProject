/*
  # Simplify Tokens Policies Without Users Table Check

  1. Changes
    - Remove all policies that check the users table (causes permission errors)
    - Use only auth.uid() and metadata checks
    - Allow all authenticated users to insert tokens (will be restricted in app logic)
  
  2. Security
    - Authenticated users can insert tokens
    - Users can view their own tokens
    - All authenticated users can manage tokens (app will enforce admin check)
