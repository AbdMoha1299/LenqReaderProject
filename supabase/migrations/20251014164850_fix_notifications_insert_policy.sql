  # Fix Notifications Insert Policy
  
  1. Problem
    - Admins cannot insert notifications when publishing editions
    - The existing "ALL" policy for admins doesn't properly allow INSERT operations
  
  2. Solution
    - Drop the existing "ALL" policy that doesn't work properly
    - Create separate policies for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE for admins
    - Keep the SELECT policy for users to view their own notifications
  
  3. Security
    - Admins can manage all notifications (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)
    - Regular users can only SELECT their own notifications
